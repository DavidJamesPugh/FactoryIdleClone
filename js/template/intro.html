    <b class="title">FACTORY IDLE</b>

    <p>
        Welcome to the crazy world of <b style="color:greenyellow">factory idle</b>! 
        Your goal here is to build an <b style="color:greenyellow">automated factory</b> 
        with many <b style="color:greenyellow">production chains</b>. 
        You start with simple stuff and later produce 
        <b style="color:rgb(150,181,134)">high quality military technology</b>, like tanks and rockets! Seriously, high quality!
    </p>

    <p>
        Path to complicated products is <u style="color:red">not an easy one</u> though, so be warned! 
        There will be great challenges ahead waiting for you! Check <b style="color:yellow">help section</b> for good ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Disclaimer</b>: This game is <b style="color:red; text-decoration:underline">harder than an average</b> idle game 
        and requires to turn on a <u style="color:orange">brain</u>. If you have more than one, turn them all ON! Overheat warning!
    </p>

    <span class="note">(except factory workers, always sue them for messing up your conveyors!)</span>
