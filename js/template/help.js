Labs require many different resources to be effective, but at the same time make production chain quite costly.<br/>\r\n        <br style="clear:both"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class="section" id="plasticProduction">\r\n        <b class="title">Setting up plastic production</b><br/>\r\n        <img src="img/tutorial/plastic.png" align="left" style="margin: 3px 6px 3px 0;"/>\r\n        Plastic production is a bit more complicated, as it also produces waste. <br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Resources come out clockwise starting from top left: plastic, waste, plastic, waste and so on. Using this piece of information, you can design your layout.<br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        Later sorters will help to organize waste handling, additionally you can research clean production that will remove waste completely after you get electronics.<br/>\r\n        <br style="clear:both"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class="section" id="sorter">\r\n        <b class="title">Sorter</b><br/>\r\n        <img src="img/tutorial/sorter2.png" style="margin: 3px 6px 3px 0;"/><br/>\r\n        <img src="img/tutorial/sorter.png" align="left" style="margin: 3px 6px 3px 0;"/><br/>\r\n        * Sorter is a safe way to sort out waste in your production lines.<br/><br/>\r\n        * Sorter needs to be configured - <b>click on the sorter</b> and set which exit should transport waste (or some other resource)<br/><br/>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n    <div class="section" id="proTips">\r\n        <b class="title">Pro tips</b><br/>\r\n        <img src="img/tutorial/orderWithNumbers.png" align="left" style="margin: 3px 6px 3px 0;"/>\r\n        * Order of outputs/inputs and conveyor crossings is always <b>top -> right -> bottom -> left (clockwise)</b>. This rule works everywhere. <br/><br/>\r\n        * You can construct multiple input/output lines from/to same component. Very useful if component produces more than one resource per tick.<br/><br/>\r\n        * Producing 20 items over 10 ticks means you need two output lines to get 100% efficiency.<br/><br/>\r\n        <br style="clear:both"/>\r\n\r\n        <img src="img/tutorial/split.png" align="right" style="margin: 3px 6px 3px 0;"/>\r\n        * Splitting conveyor path can be used to sort resources, but has limited throughput.<br/><br/>\r\n        * Multiple outputs from same component can also be used for sorting, but may jam if line gets full.<br/><br/>\r\n        * Ultimately you can use sorter component, but it also has its flaws.<br/><br/>\r\n        <br style="clear:both"/>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class="section" id="faq">\r\n        <b class="title">Frequently asked questions</b><br/>\r\n\r\n        <b style="color:lightblue; text-decoration:underline">I found a bug</b><br/>\r\n        * You probably didn\'t :) Think through your setup 3 times, if still seems like a bug, ask forums for a solution.\r\n        Don\'t forget that this game is designed to be more difficult and challenging than an average game in the same category.<br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n        <b style="color:lightblue; text-decoration:underline">Why can\'t I get 100% efficiency for a buyer</b><br/>\r\n        Check that you actually transport everything out from buyer.

It is wise to think which upgrades are good for you and which are not.\r\n        For example sometimes buying 3 upgrades at once would mean you don\'t need to change your layout. But buying one of them would mean you have to redesign a lot. <br/>\r\n        If you bought an upgrade that changes production in a way you don\'t like, just sell it and all good.<br/>\r\n        <br/>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div class="section" id="updates">\r\n        <b class="title">Updates</b><br/>\r\n\r\n        <div style="height:500px; overflow-y:scroll">\r\n\r\n            <b>V1.07</b><br/>\r\n            Quite a huge update that adds a lot of new content to the game!<br/>\r\n            + New very big factory - Terafactory!<br/>\r\n            + A lot more upgrades... like a lot!<br/>\r\n            + New late game production<br/>\r\n            + New research center with new quite fun to setup production cycle.<br/>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            As balancing late game is quite hard because of different ways how you can setup things - what do you think about the balance of new stuff?
